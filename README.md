DBMS modules including
• A paged file component which builds up the basic file system
• A record file management (tuple-oriented file) system
• An Indexing (IX) component(B+ tree) managing persistent indexes over unordered data records stored in files
• A Query Engine (QE) component answering SQL queries

I did this project on my own in the first quarter as a graduate student.
